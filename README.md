Habitual work etiquette:

1. Whenever you make a new page make sure you move it to a corresponding folder or create a new one,  
also make sure to note this in the comment when committing.

2. If you want to use a widget, button, icon or component make sure to check if the current custom component is appropriate. 

3. If rule 2 is not applicable, create a new component and label it as such, also notify this in the commit comment. 

4. Make sure you adhere to the colors from the theme folder, if you wish to change this or add colors to it, notify Niek, Don't do this without permission. 
 
5. If you want to make any app wide changes (like different buttons, change the layout, etc.) always discuss this together with the others before proposing this. 

6. Whenever you want to propose a site wide change make a separate branch with the change implemented to compare and show to the Master branch. 

7. Always keep a log of the work done even if it is a couple lines.

8. Never share the full app idea (name it a fitness app) or the feature list with outsiders. 

9. If you want to others to do something in the app message them directly, as soon as we get more than (5) developers, put it as a GitHub issue. 

10. features should be heavily bugtested before publishing it.

11. Notify others of the changes you made! Communication is key, just like when you come home you don't want all your furniture to be rearranged or even to have everything removed or changed in color!
